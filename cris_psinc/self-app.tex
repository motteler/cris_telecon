\frametitle{ccast self-apodization correction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item calculate and normalize the ILS for each sensor grid
    channel, at the sensor grid frequences, over a significantly
    extended interval

  \item truncate these to the sensor grid 

  \item these becomes the columns of the ILS as a linear transform

  \item let ILS-1 be the inverse of this matrix, and B the user-grid
    bandpass filter, as a linear transform.

 \item then B * ILS-1 * B gives the self apodization correction,
   with B acting here as a physically based stabilization of both
   rows and columns of the ILS inverse.

\end{itemize}
